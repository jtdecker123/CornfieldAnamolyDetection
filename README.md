# CornfieldAnamolyDetection
Program to find and detect objects in images of cornfields


Instructions:
To run the script on a folder of cornfield images, simply fill in the specified input path near the bottom of the file and then fill in where you want the script to place the output images, and then run it.

If you don't want to use the loops and run it on a folder, call the process_image(image_path) function on an image which will return the image with the red bounding boxes of anamolies and an array of coordinates for found anomalies called flag
